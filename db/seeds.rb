There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Come along, Pond! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard!\r\n\r\nOverconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. You are the only mystery worth solving. Geronimo! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?

Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.\r\n\r\nLook at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn.
